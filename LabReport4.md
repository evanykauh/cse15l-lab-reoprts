*Note: (1) CommonMark demo site was used to determine what should be produced by text in code snippets and (2) I used Ryan Rong's markdown-parse repository from week 7

## What Should be Produced
(as determined by [CommonMark Demo Site](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/))




For each test above:
Decide on what it should produce by using either VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site

Showing the code in MarkdownParseTest.java for how you turned it into a test

For your implementation, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.



For the implementation you reviewed in Week 7, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.
Answer the following questions with 2-3 sentences each:

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
